As you have learned in class one of the simplest types of schedules to use is a tabel driven schedual. This lab you will be creating a system to run a tabel schedual.

## What you have to do

- [ ] Creat a program in Zephyr that will run a schedule defined in a struct.
- [ ] Have the program print out the execution time to the screen.
- [ ] Use [SimSoWeb](http://projects.laas.fr/simso/simso-web) to create a scheduling diagram.

## What you need to turn in
Note: Everything should be saved to a directory called solution in your repository

- [ ] Console capture of the example schedule and your own schedule.
- [ ] The generated schedule from SimSoWeb
